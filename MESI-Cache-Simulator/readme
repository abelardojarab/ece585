The trace files are ASCII data files consisting of lines where each one has two numbers, separated by only one white space:
Label Value
where:
* Label is a decimal number that identifies the memory access operation type demanded by the processor in a given time:

0 read  request from    L1  data    cache
1 write request from    L1  data    cache
2 read  request from    L1  instruction cache
3 snooped   invalidate  command
4 snooped   read    request
5 snooped   write   request
6 snooped   read    with    intent  to modify
8 clear the cache   and reset   all state
9 print contents    and state   of  each    valid   cache   line    (allow  subsequent  trace   activity)

* Value is a 32-bit hexadecimal number that indicates the effective address of the memory word to be accessed by the processor

Format of the executable:

MESI input_file no_processors cache_size block_size
where MESI is the executable file name and input parameters are

input_file is the input benchmark name
no processors: number of processors
cache_size: cache size in bytes
block_size: block size in bytes

For example, to read MYTEST*.prg trace files for 4 processors and execute MESI cache coherence protocol with each processor containing 1K direct-mapped cache and 16 byte block size, the command will be

MESI WEATHER 4 1024 16
